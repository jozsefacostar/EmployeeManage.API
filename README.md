# EmployeeManage.API
Hello.
This is a Backend project created with DDD technologies and good software's practices.
To create a permission, you need to initially create an Employee and a Permission Type. There are two services that create the objects mentioned respectively. Then, the permissions can be created by relating the employee and the corresponding type of permission, in addition, the permissions can be modified and consulted.
